Introduction course to computational methematics. Code written in Matlab, pdf slides included.

## Outline

Slides are label and briefly cover the material for the week. Matlab code is stored in the code folder. Follow the syllabus to 
get a more detailed view of the course outline. In general the course covers the following in order: 

- Introduction to matlab.
- Using control squences in Matlab. 
- Numerical differentiation, solving linear systems.
- Numerical integration, error classification. 
- Runge-kutta methods. 
- Local truncation error, global error, and norms. 
- Modeling physical systems: the pendulum.
- Modeling physical systems: populations and epidemiology. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- Approximating functions with series, truncation error.
- Periodic functions and fourier series, discrete fourier transform.
- FFT using real data.
